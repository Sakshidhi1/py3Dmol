# py3Dmol
py3Dmol is a tool in Python that helps you see 3D pictures of molecules right inside your notebook. It works with a popular JavaScript library called 3Dmol.js but lets you use it easily in Python.
With py3Dmol, you can load molecules from different files or databases and look at them in different styles, like cartoons, sticks, or spheres. You can rotate, zoom, and explore the molecules interactively.
Itâ€™s very helpful if you want to study proteins or chemicals, especially in biology, chemistry, or drug research, and want to quickly visualize their structures without using complicated software.
